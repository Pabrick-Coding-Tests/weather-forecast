# Holition Technical Test - Weather Forecast

## Description
Create a frontend to show the next week(s) weather forecast. The design is down to the candidate to show off their frontend skills. Data is achievable via connecting to [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5/), etc.  


This is a frontend task and the main priority should be in design, styling, and then logic. We expect the candidate to create a suitable component structure, fun and engaging styling with subtle animations, and use immutable data structures with appropriate state management.  

## Deliverables
The solution should be delivered as a GitHub link and include a readme file on how to build and run the project.  

Please do not submit your solution as one commit, but multiple commits to show your working, and don’t forget to comment your code! 

Please test your submission before sending your link. Always check the node dependencies!
