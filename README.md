# Holition Technical Test - Weather Forecast

## Description
Create a frontend to show the next week(s) weather forecast. The design is down to the candidate to show off their frontend skills. Data is achievable via connecting to [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5/), etc.  


This is a frontend task and the main priority should be in design, styling, and then logic. We expect the candidate to create a suitable component structure, fun and engaging styling with subtle animations, and use immutable data structures with appropriate state management.  

## Deliverables
The solution should be delivered as a GitHub link and include a readme file on how to build and run the project.  

Please do not submit your solution as one commit, but multiple commits to show your working, and donâ€™t forget to comment your code! 

Please test your submission before sending your link. Always check the node dependencies!  

## Required Technologies / features
- The test should utilise Angular 6+ or React 16+ only.
- Advanced SASS should be used, and if off the shelf components are used we expect these to be customised e.g. Angular Material & ::dg-deep
- CSS3 Animations are expected.
- Modern JavaScript such as RxJS should be used
- A state manager should be used such as Ngrx, Mobx, Redux, etc.
- Responsive design.

## Optional
- Using TypeScript.
- Full TDD and/or BDD testing (via Mocha, Chai, Karma, Jest, etc).
- Using Three.JS / Tween.JS for 3D animations.
- Material Design / Bootstrap.

# Result
The application has been developed to show differents CSS animations for each type of weather. Due to lack of time only 3 animations out of 7 have been designed: SUN, CLOUDS and a GIF for the RAIN.

The forescast returned for the API brings a lot of information for each day, but for this example I have taken the criteria of showing only the forecast at noon (12:00pm).

If by chance the 5 next days have the same weather and you want to see all the forecast animations, it is possible to use another @Selector in the state, which will retrieve the full forecasts.

The @Selector:
````js
/* main.component.ts:27 */
@Select(WeatherState.getForecastNoon) forecast$: Observable<Weather[]>;
````

should be changed to:
````js
/* main.component.ts:27 */
@Select(WeatherState.getForecast) forecast$: Observable<Weather[]>;
````

I hope you like it!

## Thanks!
